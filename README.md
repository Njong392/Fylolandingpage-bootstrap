## My process

This site was built with love, with the following technologies..

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
-Vanilla Javascript


## What I learnt

I decided to go back on my CSS skills, just for rebranding sake. Learnt how to properly manage CSS
flexbox and media queries. Despite the very long CSS file, I got to reuse lots of code snippets for 
different elements on my site. Also learnt how to handle events in javasvript like click. 



### Continued development
I want to keep working on my CSS, especially with media queries, and better ways to structure my code :)
Build more stamina on my javascript, and move forward with it :)

## Acknowledgments

Well, I would dedicate this project to myself, because why not :) Also thanking Google for letting me rummage through their endless swirl of sites for hours! And then I'd also like to appreciate a new friend of mine. He gave me task, and it motivated me to not dump this project like I was planning to :| Hats off, and much love.
